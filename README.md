## What is this?
If you've accidentally stumbled upon this, this is one of my school IT Projects. If you are my IT Teacher, you already knew that! (Hi sir!) This project is designed to teach people about XSS (Cross Site Scripting) using an interactive slideshow, enforcing a more enjoyable way of learning XSS, compared to simply reading an article or watching a video.

## How do I access this?
